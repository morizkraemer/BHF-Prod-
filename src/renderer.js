// This file is required by the webpack.config.js and will be bundled
// This is the entry point for the renderer process
// Since we're using React via CDN, this file can be minimal
// or we can import the App component here if we want to bundle it

// The actual rendering is handled by index.html which loads App.jsx via Babel standalone
// This file just ensures webpack has an entry point
